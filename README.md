Creating a resume using markdown, github, and Jekyll

 1.	Install atom and 'launch' it.
 2.	Once atom has loaded select “create a new file” from the “file” drop down menu. In the new file write your resume in github flavored markdown format. To learn markdown format visit this link. Once you have finished writing your resume in markdown save the file as “index.md”
 3.	Visit github.com and create a new account
 4.	Check the inbox of the email account you used to create your github account. You should see a new message asking you to verify your account. Click on the link given in the email. Once the link loads you will see a webpage with a blue banner at the top notifying you that “Your email was verified”. If the page gives you the option to create your first repository skip step 5 and go straight to step 6. Else go to step 5.
 5.	Once you have logged into your github account, create a new repository using the green create button in the top right corner of the overview tab.
 6.	Select a name for your repository in the format “name.github.io”, change other settings as desired and click on create repository.
 7.	Now that you have created a repository you will be taken to a page that explains how to setup your new repository. Under the “Quick setup” you will find the hyperlink “uploading an existing file”. Click on it
 8.	A new page will open where you will be asked to choose files for your repository. Click on the “choose your files” hyperlink. Then an upload dialog box will open where you will navigate to the path/location where you saved your markdown formatted resume (index.md file).
 9.	Once the file has finished uploading scroll down to the bottom of the webpage, enter a description if desired, and click on commit changes.
 10.	Now navigate to the settings page of your github account by clicking on the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the current webpage and clicking on “Settings” in the dropdown menu that appears 
 11.	Now you should see a page that allows you to configure your repository. Below the two hyperlinks “your-account-name / reponame.github.io” there will be multiple tabs labeled “Code”, “Issues”, “Pull requests” etc.
 12.	Click on the “Settings” tab and scroll down until you see the heading “GitHub Pages”. 
 13.	Click on the dropdown menu below the subheading “Source” and select “master branch”. The page will reload.
 14.	Scroll down again until you see the heading “GitHub Pages” once more. The URL to your repository (personal website) is given inside a blue banner under the “GitHub Pages” heading that says “Your site is ready to be published at”. Click on the link inside the blue banner and your resume should load in a new tab.
 15.	Note: You can also select a theme written in Jekyll under the “Github Pages” tab.
